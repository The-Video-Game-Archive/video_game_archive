Released in September 1977, it popularized microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on swappable ROM cartridges, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976. The VCS was bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge—initially Combat and later Pac-Man.

Atari was successful at creating arcade video games, but their development cost and limited lifespan drove CEO Nolan Bushnell to seek a programmable home system. The first inexpensive microprocessors from MOS Technology in late 1975 made this feasible. The console was prototyped as codename Stella, by Atari subsidiary Cyan Engineering. Lacking funding to complete the project, Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications in 1976.

The Atari VCS launched in 1977 with nine simple, low-resolution games in 2 KB cartridges. The system's first killer app was the home conversion of Taito's arcade game Space Invaders in 1980. The VCS became widely successful, leading to the founding of Activision and other third-party game developers and to competition from console manufacturers Mattel and Coleco. By the end of its primary lifecycle in 1983–84, games for the 2600 were using more than four times the storage size of the launch games with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for, such as Activision's Pitfall!.

In 1982, the Atari 2600 was the dominant game system. Amid competition from both new consoles and game developers, a number of poor decisions from Atari management affected the company and the industry as a whole. The most public was an extreme investment into licensed games for the 2600, including Pac-Man and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Pac-Man became the system's biggest selling game, but the conversion's poor quality eroded consumer confidence in the console. E.T. was rushed to market for the holiday shopping season and was critically panned and a commercial failure. Both games, and a glut of third-party shovelware, were factors in ending Atari's relevance in the console market. Atari's downfall reverberated through the industry resulting in the video game crash of 1983.

Warner sold Atari's home division to former Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel in 1984. In 1986, the new Atari Corporation under Tramiel released a lower-cost version of the 2600 and the backward-compatible Atari 7800, but it was Nintendo that led the recovery of the industry with its 1985 launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System. Production of the Atari 2600 ended on January 1, 1992, with an estimated 30 million units sold across its lifetime.",,"MOS 6507 @ 1,19 MHz",4 kB ROM,128 bytes ram,,,GameLine,,,,,,,309,"{33,34,35,830}",a33cb6bc-361d-de50-6b2e-16e2e8049203

Julie Uhrman founded the project in 2012. She brought in designer Yves Béhar to collaborate on the design of the project, and Muffi Ghadiali as product manager to put together the engineering team. Development was funded via Kickstarter, raising $8.5 million and becoming the website's second-highest-earning project in its history.

Units started to ship to Kickstarter backers on March 28, 2013. The console was released to the general public on June 25, 2013, and features an exclusive Ouya store for applications and games designed specifically for the Ouya platform, of which the majority are casual games targeted at or used by a mass audience of casual gamers. Out of the box, Ouya supports media apps such as TwitchTV and XBMC media player. It runs a modified version of Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, and is open to rooting without voiding the warranty (developer models ordered during the Kickstarter campaign for $699 or $1,337 come pre-rooted). The console's hardware design allows it to be easily opened up, requiring only a standard screwdriver for easy modding and possible hardware addons.

All systems can be used as development kits, allowing any Ouya owner to also be a developer, without the need for licensing fees. All games are required to have some kind of free-to-play aspect, whether that be completely free, has a free trial, or has purchasable upgrades, levels, or other in-game items. The Ouya is classified as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles and as such is a rival competing against the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Wii U.

After financial issues, Ouya's employees and software assets were sold to Razer Inc., who announced the discontinuation of the Ouya console on July 27, 2015.",Android 4.1 Jelly Bean,1.7 GHz Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A9,8 GB internal flash memory,1 GiB DDR3 SDRAM,Nvidia GeForce ULP @ 520 MHz,"5.1 Surround, 2Ch Stereo",,,"Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth LE 4.0, Ethernet port","1080p, 720p","HDMI, USB 2.0, Micro USB",{294},,236,{15},996a6c9c-4d46-88d6-26ce-94ca112588dc

The console was Atari's attempt to compete with the NES and Sega Master System. Following a massive research project focused on determining exactly what consumers were demanding from a video game platform, Atari knew what it needed for its next generation system. They selected the General Computer Corporation to design new a graphics chip. ""Marie"" was what they named it. It provided a greater spectrum of colors and an endless number of sprites.

There was also one extra feature Atari added to the Marie chip. In an effort to combat third-party game manufacturers from taking a huge chunk out of their potential software profits, Atari installed an encryption algorithm (like a coded lock) into the Marie Chip. The 7800 would only allow cartridges containing a 960-bit encoded ""key"" to activate its state-of-the-art graphics and sound capabilities. If a cartridge did not include the proper coded authentication, the system remained in its default mode and could only run games made for the 2600.

With the 7800, Atari attempted to correct all of the shortcomings inherent to the 5200 platform. As stated above, the 7800 was compatible with 2600 cartridges. They had even designed an adapter (later discarded upon release) which would let the 7800 play 5200 cartridges, giving Atari across-the-board compatibility with all previous software. To make the system even more attractive to consumers considering purchasing a home computer, Atari promised an optional keyboard add-on.

While size of the 7800 console is much smaller than the immense 5200, the major improvement was made in the joystick design. The 7800 controller was made more in the tradition of the 2600. It is sleek, simple and, most importantly, durable.

In 1983, the Marie project was a courageous attempt to bring Atari back as the preeminent name in video games. Atari poured their best available personnel into the project. The system was ready and waiting to ignite the stagnant video game market.

Unfortunately timing was working against the proponents of the 7800. In 1984, Warner Communications sold Atari to Jack Tramiel. He wanted to focus on the company's computer line, and the Atari 7800 was shelved.

The video game market awoke with a roar in 1985. Nintendo had released the NES game system to American consumers. Videogame sales skyrocketed and soon Sega premiered its Sega Master System. Seeing there was money to be made, Atari scrambled to get onto the playing field and released the Atari 7800 in 1986 with only three games: Ms. Pac-Man, Joust and Asteroids.

With a paltry $300,000 advertising budget Atari gave the system a half-hearted release. Sales for the platform were good, but Atari was also trying to market a computer/console hybrid called the Atari XE and a remodeled version of the Atari 2600. All three platforms remained far behind Nintendo and Sega's offerings. By the time the Atari 7800 started to build up a substantial library of games, it was too late, and the system disappeared from store shelves.",,"Atari SALLY 6502 @ 1,19-1,79 MHz","4KB BIOS Rom, 48KB Cartridge ROM",4KB RAM,,,,ROM cartridge,,"160x240, 320x240",S-Video,,,303,{44},5a6aa7bf-c738-e463-7d68-2124b6367966

Whether or not that is true will probably remain a secret as the system's (still existing) former distributor has scrapped any documentation of the product that nearly got the company into bankruptcy. Information on the internet about the console's development history, however, is often contradictionary, inaccurate and often blatantly false. 
For instance, the most common and aggravating misconception is that the VC 4000 is ""based on"" the 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System, which supposedly was released as early as 1976! That would mean, that the technology used in the VC 4000 predates Atari's VCS by about a year and competes with Fairchild's Channel F for the title ""first 2nd generation video game system"". However, it is actually enough to compare the graphic capabilites of the two systems to realise that such information must be rubbish. So, here are some clarifying facts: 
Both, the VC 4000 and the 1292 APVS, are built around the Signetics 2650 microprocessor, which was released in late 1975. That was around the same time when Philips had bought the Signetics company and shipped the technology over to Europe. At that time Philips' subsidary Magnavox was developing a system based on the arguably more powerful Intel 8048 microprocessor - that system would later become known as the G7000 (or Odyssey² in the USA). Having one hardware product already in development, Philips decided to treat the Signetics 2650 as commercial product, targeting small-sized electronic-manufacturers, who were already swarming the market with PONG-clones. 
Considering that the VC 4000 is software-compatible (but not slot-compatible!) with the 1292 APVS, and considering that the two systems share the early half of their game library with identical game-titles implies the hypothesis that Philips sold both, the Signetics 2650 hardware and a certain number of developed ROM-software to two or three dozen companies, who developed, admittedly different, but ultimately compatible gaming systems, namely the VC 4000 and the 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System. The misconception that the 1292 APVS was released already in 1976 is probably owed to the - by now viral - misinformation that Radofin (the most prominent 1292 APVS manufacturer) released its first cosoles in 1976. These, however, were no microprocessored early wonder-machines, but plain PONG-clones. 
More evidence to support this hypothesis is provided by a Swedish TV broadcast from April 1979, when a team from SVT (Swedish broadcast company) visited the Philips-reasearch-centre in Eindhoven, Netherlands to talk about the future of video games. Throught the video the developers are seen with VC 4000 controllers, testing game prototypes which graphicly correspond with games on the VC 4000/1292 APVS and not Philips' own home console, the Videopac G7000, 
Available evidence, primarly in the form of leaflets, suggests that German manufacturer Interton was indeed the first one to hit the market with a Signetics 2650 microprocessor-based gaming system in autumn 1978: the VC 4000. Leaflets for 1292 APVS consoles by Radofin, Acetronic and other companies would only appear in 1979.",,,,,,,,,,,,{163},,134,{247},f267ebf6-0061-ccfc-2591-56d86a1b3182

By 1982, Atari game programmers realized that they were severely limited by the capabilities of the 2600 system.

The designers incorporated technology into the 5200 (called ""Pam"" in developmental stages) which they had just developed for their own 8-bit 400 and 800 series personal computer systems. The 5200 is basically a game console version of their home computer, substituting a controller in place of a keyboard.

The Intellivision system had raised the stakes in the gaming industry with its 16-position controller. Atari's own 2600 offered only 8 positions. In hopes of obliterating the competition, Atari designer, Craig Asher helped engineer the ""analog"" controller. It gives players full, 360° control of the action on-screen.

The 5200 controller contains two other features which made Atari's unique to any other system built by 1982: First, It offers speed variability. When a joystick is held in a single direction long enough, a player can increase his or her rate of on-screen movement. Second, it contains an easy-access PAUSE button, enabling players to easily freeze their games indefinitely. This immediately became a normal feature on most every subsequent system controller.

Unfortunately there turned out to be a major drawback to this groundbreaking technology. The analog controllers never caught on with consumers because they are ""non-centering,"" meaning they do not feature a neutral position. There is no way to come to an immediate stop. This factor will tend to inflict a high level of frustration on any 5200 player who tackles a game which requires precision stopping and starting movements like Frogger or Pac-Man. The controllers were also apparently not made with durability in mind and are quite easily broken.

When Atari released the 5200 it was incompatible with 2600 cartridges. Consumers who had loaded up on games for the 2600 were understandably reluctant to invest in an entirely new platform. Its initial retail price of $330 didn't cause units to fly off of the shelves either.

The 5200 also improved on the 2600 in its switch box. The 2600 system requires players to walk behind the television and change the setting on the box setting from TV to GAME. The 5200 automatically switches to GAME after the power is turned on. Also, when changing cartridges, the 5200 shifts to a black screen instead of the annoying, white noisy static players get between games with the 2600.

When the platform was launched in 1982, Atari chose not to support it with any ""must have"" new titles. Instead they decided to re-release improved versions of former best seller for the 2600 like Space Invaders or Galaxian. Later, they did offer more sought-after titles like Joust, Space Dungeon and Ms. Pac-Man, but by that time the gaming market was on the verge of collapse.

In 1983, between: Atari (with the 5200 and 2600), ColecoVision and Intellivision, the VCS (Video Computer System) market was stuck in a glut due to an oversaturation of product. Consumers were also demanding that their computers perform more functions than just play games. At that point the Commodore 64 and Atari 800XL home computers had just been released.

Even after a slow start, 1983 sales for the 5200 plummeted. Warner Communications (Atari's former parent company) reported second quarter losses of $283.4 million. By the end of the year, Atari had posted losses of $536 million. They ended production of the 5200 in 1984.",,"MOS 6502C @ 1,79 MHz",,16 KB,,,,Atari Game cartridge,,,,,,304,{62},5a305c21-915f-5a36-8488-ee6ed6256025

Aesthetically, Pocket PC 2002 was meant to be similar in design to the then newly released Windows XP. Newly added or updated programs include Windows Media Player 8 with streaming capability, MSN Messenger, and Microsoft Reader 2, with digital rights management support. Upgrades to the bundled version of Office Mobile include a spell checker and word count tool in Pocket Word and improved Pocket Outlook. Connectivity was improved with file beaming on non-Microsoft devices such as Palm OS, the inclusion of Terminal Services and Virtual Private Networking support, and the ability to synchronize folders. Other upgrades include an enhanced UI with theme support and savable downloads and WAP in Pocket Internet Explorer.

It was the most powerful game system of its time (Planet Harriers, for example, was regarded as having the best video game graphics at the time), but it was very expensive and difficult to program.

It was the first in the sixth generation of video game consoles, preceding Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube, and Microsoft's Xbox. The Dreamcast was Sega's final home console, marking the end of the company's eighteen years in the console market. 
 
In contrast to the expensive hardware of the unsuccessful Sega Saturn, the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with ""off-the-shelf"" components, including a Hitachi SH-4 CPU and an NEC PowerVR2 GPU. Released in Japan to a subdued reception, the Dreamcast enjoyed a successful U.S. launch backed by a large marketing campaign, but interest in the system steadily declined as Sony built hype for the upcoming PlayStation 2. Sales did not meet Sega's expectations despite several price cuts, and the company continued to incur significant financial losses. After a change in leadership, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast on March 31, 2001, withdrawing from the console business and restructuring itself as a third-party publisher. In total, 9.13 million Dreamcast units were sold worldwide. 
 
Although the Dreamcast had a short lifespan and limited third-party support, reviewers have considered the console ahead of its time. Its library contains many games considered innovative, including Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Phantasy Star Online, and Shenmue, as well as high-quality ports from Sega's NAOMI arcade system board.

The playing options are activated by the three switches. Each option depends on the cartridge inserted, the meaning of switches being explained on each cartridge label. The joysticks are detachable and are connected to the system through connectors placed on each side. 
 
Cartridges released are the classic ones for these systems using cartridges based on General Instrument chips: Ball games, Motorcycle, Car racing, Submarine, Super wipeout, Tank battle and maybe Shooting gallery. These are generic english titles. Real titles are in German. 
 
Concerning the Tank Battle cartridge, the problem is that this game requires digital controllers as opposed to the analog joystick of the system. The Palladium system is one of the few GI based systems which offered optional numeric keypads to play this game! 
 
The shooting games require the use of a light gun, which usually came with the cartridge. 
 
There are in fact two models of the Palladium Tele-Cassetten-Game. The cases are different (see ""more pictures"" section), but everything else is identical (games, front panel, controllers, etc.). Why two systems? Maybe Palladium first marketed this licenced product using a ""common"" case used by other brands such as MBO and Optim, and then decided to redesign its own case so that consumers would identify more clearly the Palladium system.

Microsoft offered mainstream support for Windows Mobile 5 through October 12, 2010, and extended support through October 13, 2015. It was first offered on the Dell Axim x51. It used the .NET Compact Framework 1.0 SP3, an environment for programs based on .NET. Windows Mobile 5.0 included Microsoft Exchange Server ""push"" functionality improvements that worked with Exchange 2003 SP2. The ""push"" functionality also required vendor/device support[5] With AKU2 software upgrades all WM 5.0 devices supported DirectPush. This version featured increased battery life due to Persistent storage capability. Previously up to 50% (enough for 72 hours of storage) of battery power was reserved just to maintain data in volatile RAM. This continued the trend of Windows-based devices moving from using RAM as their primary storage medium to the use of a combination of RAM and flash memory (in use, no distinction between the two is obvious to users). Programs and frequently accessed data run in RAM, while most storage is in the flash memory. The OS seamlessly moves data between the two as needed. Everything is backed up in the flash memory, so unlike prior devices, WM5 devices lose no data if power is lost. New to 5.0, OS updates were released as Adaptation kit upgrades, with AKU 3.5 being the final released.

A new version of Office was bundled called ""Microsoft Office Mobile"" which includes PowerPoint Mobile, Excel Mobile with graphing capability and Word Mobile with the ability to insert tables and graphics. Media management and playback was enhanced with Picture and Video package, which converged the management of videos and pictures and Windows Media Player 10 Mobile. Among new hardware features were enhanced Bluetooth support, default QWERTY keyboard-support and a management interface for Global Positioning System (GPS). Improvements were made to ActiveSync 4.2 with 15% increased synchronization speed. Business customers benefited from a new error reporting facility similar to that present in desktop and server Windows systems. Caller ID now supports photos so a user can apply an image to each contact to show when a call is received. DirectShow was also natively added. This release was the first to include DirectDraw with hardware acceleration, replacing the deprecated graphics component of GAPI, and Pocket MSN can be viewed directly from the Today Screen.

Windows Mobile 6 is powered by Windows CE 5.0 (version 5.2) and is strongly linked to the then newly introduced Windows Live[5] and Exchange 2007 products. Windows Mobile 6 Standard was first offered on the Orange's SPV E650,[6] while Windows Mobile 6 Professional was first offered on the O2's Xda Terra. Aesthetically, Windows Mobile 6 was meant to be similar in design to the then newly released Windows Vista. Functionally, it works much like its predecessor Windows Mobile 5, but with improved stability.

Along with the announcement of Office Mobile 6.1 with support for Office 2007 document formats (pptx, docx, xlsx); OneNote Mobile, a companion to Microsoft Office OneNote was added to most builds of WM6. In addition to the newly included programs with Office Mobile improvements were made to existing applications, such as HTML email support in Outlook Mobile. Many Windows Mobile users are enterprise users business environments were targeted. With Server Search on Microsoft Exchange 2007, Out of Office Replies with Microsoft Exchange 2007, and search ability for contacts in an Exchange Server Address Book being implemented. To aid development for programmers .NET Compact Framework v2 SP2 is now preinstalled with the OS. Developers and users also have access to Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Compact Edition for storage and retrieval of information. AJAX, JavaScript, and XMLDOM support were added to Internet Explorer Mobile along with improved devicewide Internet Sharing. Communication abilities were further enhanced with a new Microsoft Bluetooth Stack and VoIP (Internet calling) support with acoustic echo cancellation and MSRT Audio Codec.

To improve security Microsoft added Storage Card Encryption so that encryption keys are lost if device is cold-booted. Further updates, both security and feature wise, can now also be provided using Operating System Live Update.

Among other improvements: 320x320 and 800x480 (WVGA) screen resolution support (The S01SH or ""Em One"" by Sharp was the first and only device to have an 800x480 screen on WM5), Improved Remote Desktop access (Available for only certain Pocket PCs), Customer Feedback option, Smartfilter for searching within programs and Unlicensed Mobile Access (UMA) support for select operators.",,,,,,,,,,,,{702},,741,{649},2234f414-489e-189d-9a22-e3ea3baedb53

OnLive's flagship product was its cloud gaming service, which allowed subscribers to rent or demo computer games without installing them on their device. Games were delivered to OnLive's client software as streaming video rendered by the service's servers, rather than rendered locally by the device. This setup allowed the games to run on computers and devices that would normally be unable to run them due to insufficient hardware, and also enabled other features, such as the ability for players to record and spectate gameplay. The service was available through clients for personal computers and mobile devices, as well as through smart TVs and a dedicated video game console-styled device known as the OnLive Game System. OnLive also expanded into the cloud desktop market with a sister product, OnLive Desktop—a subscription service offering a cloud-based instance of Windows Server 2008 R2 accessible via tablets.

The OnLive service received mixed reception. Critics noted that the video quality and amount of input lag varied on a game-by-game basis, and did not consider OnLive to be a complete substitute to owning games and playing them on local hardware due to these inconsistencies and other factors that prospective users may consider, such as the overall cost of the service as opposed to simply upgrading their existing computers. Critics praised the service for allowing users to demo games without the need to install them, along with its built-in spectator mode.

On April 2, 2015, it was announced that Sony Computer Entertainment had acquired OnLive's patents, and that all OnLive services would be discontinued on April 30, 2015.

19,Amiga A 500,amiga-a-500,https://www.igdb.com/platforms/amiga/version/amiga-a-500,"In 1982, the Amiga Corporation developed ""Lorraine"" a computer that was named after the wife of the company's president. Amiga incorporated a 16-bit 68000 chip as Lorraine's CPU. Lorraine featured two dedicated graphics and sound chips.

By the time Lorraine was introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show on January 4, 1984, the developmental costs that Amiga had devoted to it had exceeded its resources. After Atari showed interest in purchasing the company, Commodore stepped in to outbid the console giant and renamed the system the Amiga.

Commodore made some slight modifications to the Amiga. The system's memory was upgraded to 256KB and the console was redesigned to accommodate keyboard storage underneath it. Commodore finally released the Amiga 1000 in July 1985 at a retail price of $1,295. It was compatible with home television sets and could be utilized for video editing. It featured a palette of 4,096 colors and was capable of 320 x 200 resolution. The system also featured a 3.5 inch floppy disk drive that could externally store up to 880KB.

The ""Paula"" sound chip enabled programs to be heard in stereo. The system featured two mouse/controller ports. Such peripherals as joysticks, light pens or game paddles could be used with the system. Even in its early stages of release, Commodore chose to promote the Amiga as a game machine.

The ""kickstart"" was a small part of the operating system that was contained in the ROM. The Amiga performed a kickstart or initiated the loading of the operating system itself every time the computer was activated. To fully load the operating system a 3.5 inch AmigaDos disk needed to be inserted into the external drive. Every time the computer was shut off, the operating system was lost from memory and needed to be reloaded.

The Amiga 1000 was capable of ""multitasking."" A concept similar to Windows 95, multitasking allowed users to keep two or more programs open at one time and instantly switch between them. The ""Workbench"" was the Amiga's file manager. Workbench allowed users to open windows and run programs.

In 1987, Commodore released the Amiga 500 and the Amiga 2000. The Amiga 500 was a compact system that became the best selling computer in the Amiga line. Among the improvements Commodore incorporated into the Amiga 500 were an updated operating system (AmigaDOS 1.2), 512KB RAM and a bigger keyboard. The Amiga 2000 featured a new computer case design, expansion slots and a CPU slot for future processor upgrades. It was powered by a 68000 microprocessor.

The Amiga 3000 improved on the Amiga 2000 by offering new Zorro III expansion slots, an integrated SCSI interface and a built-in hard drive. It used a 68030 32-bit microprocessor and a new version of Workbench.

In 1992 Commodore released the Amiga 600. Commodore promoted the system as a video game console with a keyboard. It quickly vanished from store shelves. Later that year Commodore released the Amiga 4000 and the Amiga 1200. The 4000 featured the speedy 68040 processor. It could display up to 256,000 colors on-screen at once. The 1200 was a compact system that combined the CPU, keyboard and disk drive into a single unit. It was similar in design to the Amiga 500. It utilized the 68020 processor and could run at 14.28MHz.

In October 1993 Commodore introduced the Amiga CD 32. This 32-bit CD-ROM based add-on featured a palette of 17 million colors. It retailed for $400 and had a built-in catalog of software because it was compatible with game titles for the failed Commodore CDTV multimedia system. Timing for the CD 32's release was not perfect. Several other CD-ROM based gaming consoles, like the 3DO and Sega CD, were released at the same time and flooded the market. The Amiga CD 32 system never gained a following.

Unfortunately, software developers rarely released programs that displayed the full potential of the Amiga's impressive graphics. The system was much more technologically advanced than its competitors. Ultimately the Amiga was viewed as an expensive gaming console, and as software support dwindled, so did sales. On April 29, 1994 Commodore announced that it was in the process of closing the company.",AmigaOS v1.2 - 1.3,Motorola 68000 @ 7.16 MHz (NTSC) 7.09 MHz (PAL),,512 kB (9 MB maximum),,4× 8-bit channels PCM at max 28 kHz with 6-bit volume in stereo,,880 kB floppy disks,,"736x567i 4-bpp PAL (736x483i 4 bpp NTSC), 368x567i 6 bpp PAL (368x483i 6 bpp NTSC)",,,,391,{134},9cf35e31-01b1-da5e-22be-7baa27c8fe9e

It was released on November 15, 2001, in North America, followed by Australia and Europe in 2002. It was Microsoft's first foray into the gaming console market. The sixth-generation console competed with Sony's PlayStation 2, Sega's Dreamcast, and the Nintendo GameCube. It was the first console produced by an American company since the Atari Jaguar ceased production in 1996.

In November 2002, Microsoft launched Xbox Live, a fee-based online gaming service that enabled subscribers to download new content and connect with other players through a broadband connection. Unlike other online services from Sega and Sony, Xbox Live had support in the original console design through an integrated Ethernet port. The service gave Microsoft an early foothold in online gaming and would help the Xbox become a relevant competitor to other sixth-generation consoles.

Xbox's successor, the Xbox 360, was launched in November 2005. The Xbox was soon discontinued beginning with Microsoft's worst-performing market, Japan, in 2005. Other countries would follow suit in 2006. The last Xbox game in Europe was Xiaolin Showdown released in June 2007, and the last game in North America was Madden NFL 09 released in August 2008. Support for out-of-warranty Xbox consoles was discontinued on March 2, 2009. Support for Xbox Live on the console ended on April 15, 2010.

Xbox launched in North America and quickly sold out. Its launch in that region was successful, selling 1.53 million units three months after launch, which is higher than its successor Xbox 360, as well as the GameCube, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and even the PlayStation 2 and Wii.

The Xbox has sold 24 million units worldwide as of May 10, 2006, according to Microsoft. This is divided out to 16 million units sold in North America, six million units in Europe, and just two million units sold in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.

The Xbox was almost always behind the PlayStation 2 in terms of sales, although in April 2004, the Xbox outsold the PS2 in the U.S. Despite lagging far behind the PlayStation 2's sales, the Xbox was overall a success (especially in North America), keeping a steady second place in the generation sales.

Nintendo aimed extensive research at a possible CD-ROM add-on for its Super NES console. They launched development projects with, ironically, Sony and Philips but were not impressed with the loading speed of the CD-ROM-based systems. Nintendo instead opted to explore the potential of combining the fastest data storage device available: the silicon-based game cartridge, with the fastest computer chip to be used in video games: the 64-bit processor.

Chairman of Nintendo of America, Howard Lincoln, teamed with Jim Clark, Chairman of Silicon Graphics, the company that had done the special effects for Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Jurassic Park. They sought to design a new game system capable of incredible graphics-rendering power. The new system was initially called, ""Project Reality."" The term ""Project Reality"" was in reference to the ""real"" three-dimensional environments that they knew could be created with the new system. The new platform would run on the powerful 100 MHz MIPS RISC microprocessor. Foreseeing the finite future of the current television standard, Nintendo made sure that ""Project Reality"" would also be compatible with HDTV (high-definition television).

On July 18, 1994, Nintendo revealed that the new name for their system, the ""Ultra 64"" (later changed to Nintendo 64), would use 500MHz DRAM memory technology from Rambus, Inc. This fast access speed would provide the means for extremely fluid three-dimensional graphics.

Nintendo announced that it would release the Nintendo 64 system to American consumers on April 21, 1996. The price would be under $250. This date was soon pushed back five months in order to allow manufacturers enough time to produce enough systems to accommodate the projected consumer demand.

When the Nintendo 64 system was finally launched on September 29, 1996, only two games were available to American consumers: Super Mario 64 and Pilot wings 64. In a move considered risky by Nintendo, no game cartridge was packaged with the Nintendo 64 system. Only the console, a single gray controller and an AC adapter were included in the original packaging. The Nintendo 64 debuted with a retail price of $199.

The Nintendo 64 system and the game Super Mario 64 opened to rave reviews from the critics. Next Generation magazine even called Super Mario 64, ""the greatest video game ever made.""

On its first day of sale, the Nintendo 64 system sold 500,000 units in North America. It took the PlayStation three months to sell the same amount. By the end of March 1997, Nintendo had sold over 3.3 million units of its new system.

Besides the obvious innovations in graphics, the Nintendo 64 featured a unique controller with fourteen buttons and an analog joystick at the center. The joystick provides complete 360° control of on-screen action. On the bottom of the controller is a quick-action ""Z-trigger"" and a multi-directional control pad. Additional controllers (in designer colors) are available for $25 each.

Players can attach an optional Controller Pak to the memory cart slot on the back of the Nintendo 64 controller. It stores a player's game statistics, preferred controller button configuration and built-up character strengths.

Nintendo introduced the Rumble Pak accessory in June 1997 along with the Star Fox 64 game cartridge. It attaches to the rear of the controller and vibrates according to various actions that occur on the screen (such as explosions or gunshots). The Rumble Pak is powered by two AAA batteries that can last up to 60 hours of play. Its retail price is $19.95.

Nintendo of America's President Minoru Arakawa announced a storage attachment for the system called the Nintendo 64 Disk Drive (64DD) in 1997. Also known as the ""bulky"" drive for its large or ""bulk"" storage capacity, the 64DD is designed to be a ""writable"" drive. Players would be able to customize existing games by introducing new characters or additional levels. This storage unit would sit beneath the Nintendo 64 console and plug into the ""EXT."" expansion connector on the bottom of the system. The magnetic disk would be capable of holding 64 megabytes. It would be about the same size of a 3.5-inch floppy disk and twice as thick. When it is inserted into the 64DD, the disk would add four megabytes to the main memory, thereby upgrading the system's total to eight megabytes. Nintendo had originally announced that the first game to use this technology would be The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. While the 64DD was originally announced to be available in 1997, Nintendo cancelled its plans to debut the system upgrade in the United States.

Nintendo announced the release of the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak on November 23, 1998. The Expansion Pak is a four-megabyte RAM cartridge that fits underneath a removable panel located on the top of the console. It will also increase the total RAM memory on the system to eight megabytes and allow select Nintendo 64 games to be played in a special high-resolution mode. The retail price for the Expansion Pak was $29.95. The first Expansion Pak compatible games to be announced were Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, NFL Quarterback Club 99 and Turok 2: Seeds of Evil.",,"64-bit 93,75 MHz NEC VR4300",64 MB Cartridge and 256 Kb Controller Pak,4 MB RDRAM,"62,5 MHz SGI RCP","16-bit, stereo, CD quality",RANDnetDD (Japan Only),Nintendo 64 Game Pak,,"256x224, 320x240 and 640x480",Composite video and S-Video,,,259,"{36,37,39,133,783}",006e42c6-3b12-11bb-ebaf-cdd120120f6e

In 1986, Commodore released the 64C computer, which is functionally identical to the original. The exterior design was remodeled in the sleeker style of the Commodore 128. The 64C uses new versions of the SID, VIC-II, and I/O chips being deployed. Models with the C64E board had the graphic symbols printed on the top of the keys, instead of the normal location on the front. The sound chip (SID) was changed to use the MOS 8580 chip, with the core voltage reduced from 12V to 9V. The most significant changes include different behavior in the filters and in the volume control, which result in some music/sound effects sounding differently than intended, and in digitally-sampled audio being almost inaudible, respectively (though both of these can mostly be corrected-for in software). The 64 KB RAM memory went from eight chips to two chips. BASIC and the KERNAL went from two separate chips into one 16 KB ROM chip. The PLA chip and some TTL chips were integrated into a DIL 64-pin chip. The ""252535-01"" PLA integrated the color RAM as well into the same chip. The smaller physical space made it impossible to put in some internal expansions like a floppy-speeder. In the United States, the 64C was often bundled with the third-party GEOS graphical user interface (GUI)-based operating system, as well as the software needed to access Quantum Link. The 1541 drive received a matching face-lift, resulting in the 1541C.

The Wii U is the first Nintendo console to support HD graphics. The system's primary controller is the Wii U GamePad, which features an embedded touchscreen, directional buttons, analog sticks, and action buttons. The screen can be used either as a supplement to the main display or in supported games to play the game directly on the GamePad. The Wii U Pro Controller can be used in its place as a more traditional alternative. The Wii U is backward compatible with all Wii software and accessories. Games can support any combination of the GamePad, Wii Remote, Nunchuk, Balance Board, or Nintendo's Classic Controller or Wii U Pro Controller. Online functionality centers around the Nintendo Network platform and Miiverse, an integrated social networking service which allowed users to share content in game-specific communities.

Response to the Wii U was mixed. It was praised for its innovative GamePad controller, improvements to online functionality over the Wii, backwards compatibility with Wii software and peripherals, and price; however, it was criticized for its user interface and functionality, and the GamePad's short battery life. It had low sales, primarily credited to a weak lineup of launch games, limited third-party support, and poor marketing including the lack of distinguishing the unique functionality of the GamePad from just being a tablet device for the Wii. Wii U production ended in January 2017. On March 3, 2017, Nintendo released its successor, the Nintendo Switch, which retained and refined concepts introduced with the Wii U.",Wii U OS,"1,24 GHz Tri-Core IBM PowerPC ''Espresso''","8 GB internal flash (Basic), 32 GB internal flash (Deluxe).

It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s home computer market dominated by the Commodore 64 and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, where it successfully established itself primarily in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and the German-speaking parts of Europe.

The series spawned a total of six distinct models: The CPC464, CPC664, and CPC6128 were highly successful competitors in the European home computer market. The later 464plus and 6128plus, intended to prolong the system's lifecycle with hardware updates, were considerably less successful, as was the attempt to repackage the plus hardware into a game console as the GX4000.

The CPC models' hardware is based on the Zilog Z80A CPU, complemented with either 64 or 128 KB of RAM. Their computer-in-a-keyboard design prominently features an integrated storage device, either a compact cassette deck or 3-inch floppy disk drive. The main units were only sold bundled with either a colour, green-screen or monochrome monitor that doubles as the main unit's power supply. Additionally, a wide range of first and third-party hardware extensions such as external disk drives, printers, and memory extensions, was available.

The CPC series was pitched against other home computers primarily used to play video games and enjoyed a strong supply of game software. The comparatively low price for a complete computer system with dedicated monitor, its high-resolution monochrome text and graphic capabilities and the possibility to run CP/M software also rendered the system attractive for business users, which was reflected by a wide selection of application software.

Most handheld PCs use an operating system specifically designed for mobile use.

The first hand-held device compatible with desktop IBM personal computers of the time was the Atari Portfolio of 1989.

After 2000 the handheld PC segment practically halted, replaced by other forms, although later communicators such as Nokia E90 can be considered to be of the same class.

Later releases had a similar black controller, with an 8-pointed star-shaped housing for its eight-direction joystick. In the upper corner of the joystick was a single 'Action' button, silver on the original controllers and red on the black controllers. The games, graphics and packaging were designed by Ron Bradford and Steve Lehner.

One other difference in these controllers is that the earliest releases of the silver joystick were removable. They could be plugged and unplugged from the back of the unit, while all later silver and all black controllers were hardwired into the rear of the unit itself (although the joysticks still can be easily replaced, but not without dismounting the cover deck).

One of the strongest points of the system was its speech synthesis unit, which was released as an add-on for speech, music, and sound effects enhancement. The area that the Odyssey² may be best remembered for was its pioneering fusion of board and video games: The Master Strategy Series. The first game released was Quest for the Rings!, with gameplay somewhat similar to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and a storyline reminiscent of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. Later, two other games were released in this series, Conquest of the World and The Great Wall Street Fortune Hunt, each with its own gameboard.

Its graphics and few color choices, compared to its biggest competitors at the time—the Atari 2600, Mattel's Intellivision and the Bally Astrocade—were its ""weakest point"". Of these systems, the Odyssey² was listed by Jeff Rovin as being the third in total of sales, and one of the seven major video game suppliers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,112,"{215,216}",13737f46-63a6-87c5-a6fc-b46c62e3b44d

Released in August 1986 as the successor to the Nintendo VS. System, the PlayChoice-10 was developed as a means to showcase NES games while maintaining revenue from the arcade business; it did so by allowing players to test up to ten games, one at a time.

Two upright cabinet variants of the PlayChoice-10 were offered: a stacked dual-screen one and a single-screen one. A ""cabaret"" variant of the dual-screen cabinet, featuring a 9-inch screen on top of a 15-inch one instead of two 25-inch screens, was available in markets outside the United States. Conversion kits were also available for both dual-screen and single-screen formats, with the former intended for converting Punch-Out!! cabinets and the latter intended for converting standard Nintendo cabinets; the company later offered conversion kits for VS. UniSystem cabinets, with a five-game PlayChoice-5 kit made available alongside the standard ten-game kit. Nintendo additionally offered a countertop variant of the PlayChoice-10: the PlayChoice CounterTop System, which featured two control sets side-by-side. Games were distributed on printed circuit boards (PCBs) featuring ROM chips and were connected to the motherboard with edge connectors.

Gameplay is restricted to a set time limit, with two minutes available at minimum; inserting additional coins before play results in bonus session time (called ""Prime Time"") on top of the added time. Players are able to freely switch between games by pressing a button that invoked a game selection menu; they are also able to pause and reset the current game. Dual-screen cabinets displayed the selection menu and game instructions on the top screen and the gameplay on the bottom screen.

The initial model, the 520ST, saw limited release in April–June 1985 and was widely available in July. It was the first personal computer with a bitmapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's GEM from February 1985.

The 1040ST, released in 1986 with 1 MB of RAM, was the first home computer with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US$1. It is part of a mid-1980s generation of computers with 16- or 32-bit processors, 256 KB or more of RAM, and mouse-controlled graphical user interfaces. (Other examples include the Macintosh, Amiga, Apple IIGS, and Acorn Archimedes.)

""ST"" officially stands for ""Sixteen/Thirty-two"", referring to the Motorola 68000's 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals. The system was designed by a small team led by Shiraz Shivji.

The ST was sold with either Atari's color monitor or less expensive monochrome monitor. Color graphics modes were available only on the former while the highest-resolution mode required the monochrome monitor. Some later models could display the color modes on a TV.

In some markets, particularly Germany, the ST gained a foothold for CAD and desktop publishing. With its built-in MIDI ports, it was popular for music sequencing and as a controller of musical instruments among amateurs and professional musicians.

79,ZX Spectrum,zx-spectrum,https://www.igdb.com/platforms/zxs/version/zx-spectrum,"The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd.

Referred to during development as the ZX81 Colour and ZX82, the machine was launched as the ZX Spectrum by Sinclair to highlight the machine's colour display, compared with the black and white of its predecessor, the ZX81. The Spectrum was ultimately released as eight different models, ranging from the entry level model with 16 KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128 KB RAM and built in floppy disk drive in 1987; together they sold in excess of 5 million units worldwide (not counting numerous clones).

The Spectrum was among the first mainstream audience home computers in the UK, similar in significance to the Commodore 64 in the USA. The introduction of the ZX Spectrum led to a boom in companies producing software and hardware for the machine, the effects of which are still seen; some credit it as the machine which launched the UK IT industry. Licensing deals and clones followed, and earned Clive Sinclair a knighthood for ""services to British industry"".

The Commodore 64, Oric-1 and Atmos, BBC Microcomputer and later the Amstrad CPC range were rivals to the Spectrum in the UK market during the early 1980s. Over 24,000 software titles have been released since the Spectrum's launch and new titles continue to be released--over 100 in 2012. In 2014, a bluetooth keyboard modelled on the Spectrum was announced.",,Z80A,,,,,,,,,,{599},,371,{131},a83400a5-0902-a6a6-bf0a-1b9314844532

It is part of a group of software-compatible consoles which include the Interton VC-4000 and the Voltmace Database.
Both, the VC 4000 and the 1292 APVS, are built around the Signetics 2650 microprocessor, which was released in late 1975. That was around the same time when Philips had bought the Signetics company and shipped the technology over to Europe. At that time Philips' subsidary Magnavox was developing a system based on the arguably more powerful Intel 8048 microprocessor - that system would later become known as the G7000 (or Odyssey² in the USA). Having one hardware product already in development, Philips decided to treat the Signetics 2650 as commercial product, targeting small-sized electronic-manufacturers, who were already swarming the market with PONG-clones.
More evidence to support this hypothesis is provided by a Swedish TV broadcast from April 1979, when a team from SVT (Swedish broadcast company) visited the Philips-reasearch-centre in Eindhoven, Netherlands to talk about the future of video games. Throught the video the developers are seen with VC 4000 controllers, testing game prototypes which graphicly correspond with games on the VC 4000/1292 APVS and not Philips' own home console, the Videopac G7000.
The misconception that the 1292 APVS was released already in 1976 is probably owed to the - by now viral - misinformation that Radofin (the most prominent 1292 APVS manufacturer) released its first cosoles in 1976. These, however, were no microprocessored early wonder-machines, but plain PONG-clones.",,8-bit Signetics 2650AI at 4.43 MHz,,"43 bytes, optional 1k RAM","Signetics 2636N at 3.58 MHz, addressing 32Kb of memory in 8Kb banks",Single Channel (beep),,2-8 KByte ROM Cartridges,,208x108,RF,,,135,{697},4e23c492-c481-dfad-08f7-813c4ab8b36b
200,Initial version,initial-version,https://www.igdb.com/platforms/pc-50x-family/version/initial-version,"The world was undergoing ""PONG Madness"". It seemed only natural that developers would create advancements to the original AY-3-8500 chip to incorporate color and even more games. This explains the amount of PONG systems since each machine contained a different chip. However things were handled different in some areas particularly in Europe. 
 
Europe did not see the release of the Intellivision and Atari 2600 till the early 1980s. This allowed Pong to have a longer success. Rather then creating a new machine for each new chip, developers took the General Instruments popular line of chips and slapped them into cartridges. These carts were not like ROM carts used in later systems. They simply housed a specific General Instruments processor chip with pin outs to interface with a console. These were the PC-50X line of cartridges. 
 
With the PC-50X cartridges available, console manufacturers were able to produce a machine that could play several games and market them at a low cost. The units were made in various countries and were marketed by Creatronic, Hanimex, ITMC, Rollet, GrandStand, Soundic and lord knows how many other manufacturers. There are literally over two hundred console variations that utilized this technology. 
 
The initial model SD-050 varied in terms of outward appearance (colors, etc), manufacturers names and slight modifications. However each unit had the same overall design with two detachable controllers with 10 buttons located on the top of the machine. These 10 buttons, which clearly identify a PC-50X based console, were used to select the different games available on each cart. The SD-050 model only produced black and white video. 
 
New models such as the SD-070 and SD-090 appeared and sold well into the 80s since the units were far cheaper then the newer consoles making waves in the US and Japan. These newer models played the same carts, but added additional settings, sound and SECAM color (4 colors).",,,,,,,,,,,,{161},,131,{244},c9a97d1e-baec-890e-a1b6-1532f207956a
